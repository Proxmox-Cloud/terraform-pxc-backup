## E2E tests

Additionally to the normal pve cloud setup for e2e tests, in order to test this you have to have [pve-cloud-backup](github.com/Proxmox-Cloud/pve-cloud-backup) either installed via pypi or locally checked out and installed via tddog into your e2e python environment. The e2e tests in this repo invoke functions from there.
